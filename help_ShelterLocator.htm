        <h1>How to use the Shelter Locator</h1>
	    <p>The <b>Shelter Locator</b> application helps citizens locate and obtain information about services available at shelters in their community.  This application could be used to share information about shelters in a community that are always available to citizens that require support or stood up in time of emergency to communicate about new shelter locations available to house displaced citizens.<br/> <br/>To locate a shelter, simply enter an address or shelter name in the search box, or select amentities.  Optionally, you can use your current location to find a shelter near you.  The shelter(s) will then be highlighted on the map and relevant information about available support services presented to you.</p>
	    <h3><u>Using the Application</u></h3>
	    <p>The Shelter Locator application provides residents an easy way to find shelters near them or a shelter by its name.  Enter your address or click on the Current Location button to find shelters near you.  If you click the Current Location button, it will use the location of your computer's IP address or your cell phone/tablet location to locate shelters near you. When you enter an address or use your current location, the application will present a list of shelters near you and allow you to review relevant information about each shelter.  In addition, you can search for a shelter, or specific amenity you require, by name.  To do that, enter the name of the shelter in the search box.
